# Threathunt.blog
Queries from my Threat Hunting related blog, available here: https://threathunt.blog/

The queries are stored in individual files, one for each of the blog posts. There is no metadata or anything, just the queries separated by a line break. The idea behind them are shown in the blog, which is why I do not add anything here. The queries are stored in GitHub only to make it easier to copy them over if the need be.
